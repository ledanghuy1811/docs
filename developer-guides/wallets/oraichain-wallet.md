# Oraichain Wallet (OBSOLETE)

Oraichain Wallet is still available on [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/oraichain-wallet/id1578250609), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.orai.wallet\&hl=en\&gl=US) but will not get new updates. We highly recommended that users should use the OWallet to continue delegating Native ORAI on the Oraichain network and experiencing more features within the ecosystem. Since both are non-custodial wallets, users can securely use the same mnemonic to get access to your Oraichain account.&#x20;

For those having logged into Oraichain Wallet via a desktop browser, you have to have that browser session available and use the [Web version (deprecated)](https://api.wallet.orai.io) to retrieve access to your account.
