# CosmWasm IDE

[**CosmWasm IDE**](https://github.com/oraichain/cw-ide-vscode) is a tool that simplifies CosmWasm smart contract development & deployment processes. It integrates with Gitpod & Keplr to create a simple yet powerful environment to build, deploy, and interact with CosmWasm smart contracts through default and custom networks using CosmWasm. With Gitpod, CosmWasm developers can develop smart contracts on the browser.&#x20;

CosmWasm IDE is currently maintained by Oraichain & CosmWasm.
